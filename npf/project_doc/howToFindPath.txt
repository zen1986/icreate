use A*search

use mapNode to find path
1. replace the cost calculation with time:
		distance between node
	time =  ---------------------
		   estimated speed
	the speed could be 3m/s for walking or 10m/s for bus travelling 

2. when we get a neighbor node, we first cast it to its original type, i.e. building / busstop / empty
   then we decide which speed to use.
   
   	for g value 
   	if both node are bus stop then pick bus speed , otherwise pick walk speed 
	for f value 
	if start node is bus stop then take bus speed , otherwise take walk speed
